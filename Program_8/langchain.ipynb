      "This report provides an overview of GenAI, a cutting-edge AI algorithm capable of producing novel content across various formats, including text, audio, video, images, and code. GenAI tools have progressed to human-level performance due to advances in machine learning, large datasets, and increased computing power, leading to their metamorphosis from research prototypes to accessible, easy-to-use production tools. This rapid advancement has sparked enthusiasm among businesses and investors, with generative AI startups raising significantly more capital in 2022 compared to 2020. \n",

      "\n",
      "1. Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) tools are becoming increasingly accessible and user-friendly, supercharging business processes and operations, and enabling the creation of new deliverables that were previously impractical due to economic or technological constraints. \n",

      "2. This progress is primarily driven by the emergence of large language models (LLMs), which have seen widespread usage and adoption. \n",
      "\n",
      "3. While GenAI models leverage various statistical and computational techniques across different modalities, the report primarily focuses on LLMs due to their central role in driving the overall usage of generative AI models and their importance\n"
