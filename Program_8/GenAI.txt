Principles of Generative AI
A Technical Introduction
Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools are an emerging class of new-age artificial
intelligence algorithms capable of producing novel content — in varied formats such as text,
audio, video, pictures, and code — based on user prompts. Recent advances in machine
learning (ML), massive datasets, and substantial increases in computing power have propelled
such tools to human-level performance on academic and professional benchmarks , 1
comparable to the ninetieth percentile on the SAT and the bar exam.
This rapid progress has led many to to believe that the metamorphosis of these technologies 2
from research-grade demos to accessible and easy-to-use production-grade goods and
services carries the potential to supercharge business processes and operations while enabling
entirely new deliverables heretofore rendered infeasible by economic or technological factors. It
took OpenAI’s ChatGPT, a conversational web app based on a generative (multimodal)
language model, about five days to reach one million users (compared to 2.5 months for 3
Instagram). On the business side, the Economist reports that the number of jobs mentioning AIrelated skills quadrupled from 2022 to 2023. This enthusiasm has not gone unmet by investors.
Generative AI startups reportedly raised 600% more capital in 2022 than in 2020 . 4

Purpose and Scope
What are these new-era AI technologies? How do they function? What principles do they
operate on? What makes them different than already-hyped-up conventional machine learning
(ML) models? For what tasks is this class of technology most impactful? What future advances
might one look forward to? These are the questions this report attempts to shed some light on.
The report will also tease out how this understanding foundationally informs the best uses (and
misuses) of GenAI in applied contexts.
A word of disclaimer: this gradient of topics also means that, while the initial sections deal with
factual, if somewhat simplified, nuts-and-bolt workings of such models, the later sections delve
into hopefully reasonable, but in a manner that only time may attest to, extrapolations and
speculations, as necessitated by the developing nature of this technology and its current phase
in the technology adoption cycle.
While generative AI models come in many different shapes, utilizing varied statistical and
computational techniques to target various modalities, ranging from code and text to audio and
video, this report focuses almost exclusively on large language models (LLMs) capable of
generating novel text from textual prompts. This choice is partly due to the substantial lead
LLMs have in driving the overall usage of generative AI models and partly due to the centrality 5
of language in formulating and addressing commonplace information-processing tasks. That
said, image- and code-based GenAI models have already witnessed successful commercial
product deployment, for example, by Adobe for creating visual content and by Github as a
programming assistance tool.

code from specifications given as natural language. Reportedly, as
of June 2023, it served over a million users.
